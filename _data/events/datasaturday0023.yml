During these days after the unprovoked aggressive attack by Russia on Ukraine, it is hard to find the right words for our CfS announcement.
We have friends living in Ukraine and friends from Ukraine living here in Norway with family stuck in a terrible situation in their home country.
We were looking forward to welcome you all to Oslo for our first in-person event in two years and understandably our excitement about this announcement has been dialed down to zero due to the Russian attack.

However, the date for Data Saturday Oslo event is this year on Saturday 10th September. If you would like to submit a talk, please use the link below.
Please note that even though we welcome speaker submissions from all over the world, we will take a preference to speakers living in Norway, Sweden, Finland and Denmark in our selection process.
