# Anti Harassment Policy Plan - Sample Meeting Agenda

This document is intended to assist event organisers with the creation of the AHP Plan for their event by providing an Agenda for an organisers meeting to ensure all points are thought about. A sample - framework plan can be found here - https://github.com/dataplat/DataSaturdays/blob/AHP-plan/docs/AHP-sample-plan.md

## Agenda

1. Welcome
2. Reasoning for having a plan
    - Having this written down in advance when everyone is calm and rational will enabled us to ensure that as much is covered as possible.
    - It also makes it easier to just pick up and follow
    - It also ensures that all organisers are on the same page
3. Location of the plan 
4. who requires access to the plan 
5. The plan. Points for discussion, not all will be required
    - Who will communicate with the harasser?
         - Considerations. The person should be confident, good at de-escalation, there are views that choosing a person early in their career or under represented minorities carries risk.
