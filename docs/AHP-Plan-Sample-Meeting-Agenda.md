# Anti Harassment Policy Plan - Sample Meeting Agenda

This document is intended to assist event organisers with the creation of the AHP Plan for their event by providing an Agenda for an organisers meeting to ensure all points are thought about. A sample - framework plan can be found here - https://github.com/dataplat/DataSaturdays/blob/AHP-plan/docs/AHP-sample-plan.md

Feel free to update this, you will need to fork and create a PR - Its not scary, GitHub will do it all for you - https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/editing-files#editing-files-in-another-users-repository

It is important to note that what this is, is a suggestion of meeting bullet points to enable you to discuss "what to do if"

## Agenda

1. Welcome
2. Reasoning for having a plan
    - Having this written down in advance when everyone is calm and rational will enabled us to ensure that as much is covered as possible.
    - It also makes it easier to just pick up and follow
    - It also ensures that all organisers are on the same page
3. Location of the plan 
4. who requires access to the plan 
5. Is legal representation, discussion required now or in the future? 
    - What about ticket terms and conditions?
    - What about if it involves a sponsor?
    - What about refunds?
7. The plan. Points for discussion, not all will be required
    - Who will communicate with the harasser?
         - Considerations. The person should be confident, good at de-escalation, there are views that choosing a person early in their career or under represented minorities carries risk.
