> Hey man! I see that you changed the way the site generator works... I'm totally ok with that, but I guess it needs stronger testing compared to editing the page/yml/whatever of the single event. @SQLDBAWithABeard thoughts?

That is correct. I have made quite a few changes in order to get the type event page and info we wanted to present.

These are the changes I have made over the course of a few months:
* New attribute to show/hide the top-logo: hide-toplogo: true/false
* New attribute to show/hide the join room section: hide-join-room-section: true/false
* New attribute that opens the event registration in a new tab: open-registration-new-tab: true/false
* Added a new section for pre-con's which adds a new menu-item: precondescription
* Added a new attribute that enables a new button for people to download the Sessionize schedule app for the event:  scheduleapp
* Added a new attribute that shows the venue physical location using Google Maps: enuemap
* Added a new attribute that shows the events Code of Conduct which also enables a new menu item: codeofconduct

I think that was it. As @SQLDBAWithABeard mentions the new attributes for margins for sponsor logos have a default setting and that also applies for all the other functionality I have added
